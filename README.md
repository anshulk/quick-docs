# quick-docs package

Atom package to view docs of a function under cursor. PHP for now.

Combines [inline-messenger](http://atom.io/packages/inline-messenger) and [php-documentation-onine](https://atom.io/packages/php-documentation-online). Thanks a lot to developers of both packages. Install inline-messenger and customize the look of pop-ups.

Press `ctrl-shift-q` to fetch and display PHP docs and signature for the function under cursor. Quite slow for now, looking for a better method of fetching docs.

Contributions welcome :)
